## 🧠 What I Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I explored several important frontend concepts, including:

- ✅ How to **fetch and parse data from a public API**
- ✅ Handling **asynchronous operations** using `async/await`
- ✅ Efficient DOM rendering using **template cloning**
- ✅ Managing **UI state**, such as highlighting the active navigation tab
- ✅ Structuring a **scalable and reusable layout** using Flexbox
- ✅ Designing a **responsive search bar and cards layout**
- ✅ Handling **empty or broken API responses** gracefully

This project helped me improve my understanding of frontend flow — from layout to interactivity — using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
